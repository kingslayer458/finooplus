# 🎉 Your CI/CD Application is Running!

## ✅ What's Working

Your application is successfully deployed on Kubernetes with 3 running pods!

## 🌐 How to Access Your Application

### **Method 1: Port-Forward (WORKING) ✅**

Run this command (keep it running):
```powershell
kubectl port-forward service/sample-web-app-service 8080:80
```

Then open in browser: **http://localhost:8080**

### **Method 2: Use the Quick Script (EASIEST) ✅**

```powershell
.\open-app.ps1
```

This automatically starts port-forwarding and opens your browser!

## ❌ Why localhost:30080 Doesn't Work

**Docker Desktop Kubernetes Limitation**: NodePort services don't work with `localhost` on Windows because Kubernetes runs in a Linux VM with an internal network that's not directly accessible from Windows.

**See [`ACCESSING-APP.md`](ACCESSING-APP.md ) for detailed explanation and alternatives.**

## 📊 Your Deployment Status

```powershell
# Check pods (should show 3 running)
kubectl get pods

# Check services
kubectl get svc

# View application logs
kubectl logs -l app=sample-web-app --tail=20
```

## 🎯 Test Your Application

Once you open http://localhost:8080 in your browser:

1. ✅ You'll see a beautiful purple gradient web page
2. ✅ Click **"Check Health Status"** - should return healthy status
3. ✅ Click **"Get Message from API"** - should return "Hello from CI/CD Pipeline!"

## 🔧 Useful Commands

```powershell
# Restart deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment sample-web-app

# Scale replicas
kubectl scale deployment sample-web-app --replicas=5

# Watch pod status
kubectl get pods -w

# Port-forward (if not running)
kubectl port-forward service/sample-web-app-service 8080:80

# View real-time logs
kubectl logs -f -l app=sample-web-app

# Delete everything
kubectl delete -f k8s/
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that your app is running, you can:

1. **Set up Jenkins** - Continue with Part 6 of [`SETUP-GUIDE.md`](SETUP-GUIDE.md )
2. **Make code changes** - Edit server.js and redeploy
3. **Test auto-scaling** - The HPA will scale based on load
4. **Add monitoring** - Set up Prometheus/Grafana

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App not accessible?
```powershell
# Make sure port-forward is running
kubectl port-forward service/sample-web-app-service 8080:80

# Check pods are running
kubectl get pods

# Check pod logs for errors
kubectl logs -l app=sample-web-app
```

### Need to rebuild and redeploy?
```powershell
# Build new image
docker build -t sample-web-app:latest .

# Restart deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment sample-web-app
```

## 📝 Summary

- ✅ **Application**: Running with 3 pods
- ✅ **Access**: http://localhost:8080 (with port-forward)
- ✅ **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/api/health
- ✅ **API Endpoint**: http://localhost:8080/api/message
- ❌ **NodePort 30080**: Not accessible (Docker Desktop limitation)

**Your app is working perfectly! Just use port-forward (port 8080) instead of NodePort. 🎉**
